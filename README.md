- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Adrian, 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m mostly interested in web development, but I like real programming as well.
- ðŸ“ŽI recently switched projects and had some time to catch up on my little [board game implementation](https://github.com/generalustelaru/ophir-2d). Check it out if you're not afraid to install some dependencies. Or try out my older works: [Depth Dodger](https://github.com/generalustelaru/depth-dodger) and [Super Nibbler](https://github.com/generalustelaru/super-nibbler)

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: adrianpope@proton.me
